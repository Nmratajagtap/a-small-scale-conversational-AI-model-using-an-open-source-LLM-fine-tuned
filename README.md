Bilingual Conversational AI (English + Hindi)

This project demonstrates a basic workflow for building a small-scale conversational AI model fine-tuned for English and Hindi, using an open-source Large Language Model (LLM).

Project Overview

The goal of this project was to explore the process of fine-tuning an open-source LLM to handle conversational data in both English and one Indian language (Hindi). Due to limitations in accessing gated models within the environment, a smaller, publicly available model (GPT-2) was used as a substitute for demonstration purposes, along with a dummy dataset.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

#pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

#datasets: For working with datasets.

#transformers: For loading and fine-tuning the language model.

#torch: The deep learning framework used by transformers.

#huggingface_hub: (Optional, but useful for accessing models from Hugging Face)
