Building a small-scale conversational AI model fine-tuned for an Indian language and English is a complex task. Here is a plan that breaks it down into manageable steps:

Choose an open-source llm: Select an appropriate open-source LLM (e.g., LLaMA 2, Mistral, or BLOOM) that is suitable for fine-tuning.
Select an indian language: Choose one Indian language to fine-tune the model for, in addition to English.
Prepare a bilingual dataset: Create or acquire a dataset containing conversational data in both the selected Indian language and English. This dataset will be used for fine-tuning.
Fine-tune the llm: Use the prepared bilingual dataset to fine-tune the chosen open-source LLM. This step involves training the model on the new data to improve its performance in the target languages and conversational style.
Evaluate the fine-tuned model: Assess the performance of the fine-tuned model using appropriate metrics and test cases. This will help determine how well the model understands and generates responses in both the Indian language and English.
Deploy the model: Once the model is fine-tuned and evaluated, deploy it for use in a conversational AI application.
Finish task: Summarize the process and present the results.
